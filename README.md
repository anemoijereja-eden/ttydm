# TTY DM
## A minimal pseudo-display-manager for pure linux tty setups

TTY DM takes the place of the getty login prompt on one of your TTYs and provides a clean, visual login method for selecting and logging into a terminal multiplexer, replicating the experience of logging into a desktop.

TTY DM is written in python and designed to be as small as possible.
